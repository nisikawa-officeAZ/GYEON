## 1b. Phase 2 — Customer & Vehicle Registration

### Sprint 1 — Customer & Vehicle Registration Foundation — ✅ Completed (2026-06-30)

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Completed | ✅ |
| Committed | ✅ `feat: phase2 sprint1 customer vehicle registration foundation` (74fec20) |
| Pushed | ✅ feature branch `fix/branding-schema-block` (not merged to main) |
| Typecheck | ✅ `npm run typecheck` passed |
| Build | ✅ `npm run build` passed |
| Sprint 2 | 🔴 Not started |

**Summary:**
- Customer duplicate detection helper implemented (`src/lib/customers/find-customer-duplicates.ts`, dealer-scoped).
- Vehicle duplicate detection helper implemented (`src/lib/vehicles/find-vehicle-by-vin-or-plate.ts`, dealer-scoped).
- `register-from-ocr` orchestration implemented (`src/lib/ocr/register-from-ocr.ts`) — creates/reuses customer + linked vehicle and completes the OCR session, composing existing create actions.
- Existing UI wired to the registration flow (`CustomerVehicleOnboardingWizard.tsx`) with non-blocking duplicate warnings; no UI redesign.

Scope guardrails honored: no schema change, no migration, no production deploy, no merge to main. Architecture preserved (dealer_id always from `getCurrentDealer()`; RLS assumptions unchanged).

### Sprint 2 — Customer Management Foundation — ✅ Completed (2026-06-30)

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Completed | ✅ |
| Committed | ✅ `feat: phase2 sprint2 customer management foundation` (493031f) |
| Pushed | ✅ feature branch `fix/branding-schema-block` (not merged to main) |
| Typecheck | ✅ `npm run typecheck` passed |
| Build | ✅ `npm run build` passed |
| Sprint 3 | (superseded — now complete, see below) |

**Summary:** Customer list (functional search + filters + detail navigation), Customer Detail page (`/customers/[id]`), Customer Search (controlled), Customer Filters, Customer Profile editing (reused `CustomerForm`), Customer Timeline (reused `CustomerActivityTimeline`), Customer Notes (`updateCustomerNotes`), derived Customer Status & Tags foundations, and navigation integration. No schema change; status/tags derived from existing columns.

### Sprint 3 — Vehicle Management Foundation — ✅ Completed (2026-06-30)

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Completed | ✅ |
| Committed | ✅ `feat: phase2 sprint3 vehicle management foundation` (6462a99) |
| Pushed | ✅ feature branch `fix/branding-schema-block` (not merged to main) |
| Lint | ✅ no `lint` script / ESLint config in repo (same as Sprints 1–2); not applicable |
| Typecheck | ✅ `npm run typecheck` passed |
| Build | ✅ `npm run build` passed |
| Sprint 4 | 🔴 Not started |

**Completed work:**
- Vehicle List page — functional search + filters + row navigation to detail.
- Vehicle Detail page — `src/app/vehicles/[id]/page.tsx` (dealer-scoped fetch + `notFound`).
- Vehicle Search — controlled `VehicleSearch` (maker / model / plate; space-insensitive).
- Vehicle Filters — `VehicleFilters` (車検: 有効/間近/切れ/未登録; 顧客: 紐付きあり/なし) + shown/total count.
- Vehicle Profile editing — reused `VehicleForm` (edit toggle on detail + list modal).
- Vehicle Status foundation — derived `deriveVehicleStatus` from `inspection_expiry_date` + `VehicleStatusBadge` (read-only).
- Vehicle Tags foundation — derived `deriveVehicleTags` + `VehicleTagList` (read-only).
- Vehicle Service History foundation — `VehicleServiceHistory` via `getActivityLogsByEntity("vehicle", id)`.
- Customer ↔ Vehicle relationship verification — owner resolved via dealer-scoped `getCustomerById`; same-dealer ownership confirmed and linked, mismatch flagged; write paths still validate `customer_id` belongs to the dealer.
- Navigation integration — list → `/vehicles/[id]`; detail → back link + 所有者 link to `/customers/[id]`.

Scope guardrails honored: no schema change, no migration, no production deploy, no merge to main. Sprint 1 OCR registration flow and duplicate-detection logic untouched. Architecture preserved (dealer_id always from `getCurrentDealer()`; RLS assumptions unchanged).

### Sprint 4 — Vehicle Registration OCR & AI Enhancement — ✅ Completed (2026-06-30)

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Completed | ✅ |
| Committed | ✅ `feat: phase2 sprint4 ocr ai enhancement` (5a4937b) |
| Pushed | ✅ feature branch `fix/branding-schema-block` (not merged to main) |
| Lint | N/A — no `lint` script / ESLint config in repo (same as Sprints 1–3) |
| Typecheck | ✅ `npm run typecheck` passed |
| Build | ✅ `npm run build` passed |
| Sprint 5 | 🔴 Not started |

**Completed work:**
- OCR review flow improvements — low-confidence warning + missing important-field summary in `VehicleRegistrationOcrReview` (customer/vehicle shown separately).
- Camera / File selection improvements — clearer selection UI in `VehicleRegistrationUpload`.
- Mobile camera-first behavior — camera capture is the primary action on mobile.
- Desktop upload support — file upload preserved as the primary path on desktop.
- AI field mapping improvements — `mapOcrToVehicle` model now falls back to 型式 when 車名 is absent.
- Missing-field handling — new `ocr-field-analysis.ts` detects important fields the model failed to read.
- Confidence handling — confidence level classification (high/medium/low/none) surfaced in review.
- Duplicate review improvements — confirm step now lists matched customers (name/phone) and vehicles (maker/model + plate/VIN); detection core logic unchanged.
- Preserved register-from-ocr orchestration — `register-from-ocr.ts` untouched.

Scope guardrails honored: no schema change, no migration, no production deploy, no merge to main. OCR/AI output remains fully editable and requires explicit user confirmation before any write. Sprint 1 orchestration + duplicate-detection core preserved. Architecture preserved (dealer_id always from `getCurrentDealer()`; RLS assumptions unchanged).

### Sprint 5 — OCR Session & Audit Foundation — ✅ Completed (2026-06-30)

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Completed | ✅ |
| Committed | ✅ `feat: phase2 sprint5 ocr session and audit foundation` (bfd21b7) |
| Pushed | ✅ feature branch `fix/branding-schema-block` (not merged to main) |
| Lint | N/A — no `lint` script / ESLint config in repo (same as Sprints 1–4) |
| Typecheck | ✅ `npm run typecheck` passed |
| Build | ✅ `npm run build` passed |
| Sprint 6 | 🔴 Not started |

**Completed work:**
- OCR session summary foundation — `src/lib/ocr/ocr-session-summary.ts` (status meta, reviewed-result summary, link outcome).
- OCR status badge — `OcrStatusBadge` (draft/processing/reviewing/completed/abandoned).
- OCR history viewer — `OcrSessionList` + `/ocr-sessions` page (dealer-scoped), links to resulting customer/vehicle.
- OCR correction/review audit foundation — `OcrAuditTrail` over dealer-scoped `audit_logs` (resource_type `vehicle_registration`); reviewed_result shown as the corrected output.
- Existing customer selection after duplicate detection — wizard "この顧客を使用" reuses the `existingCustomerId` path.
- Existing vehicle selection after duplicate detection — wizard "この車両を更新" routes to manual edit (no auto-overwrite, no duplicate created).
- Register / Update decision flow — confirm-step decision summary (顧客 = 新規/既存, 車両 = 新規/既存更新).
- OCR processing status management — session status surfaced via badges in the history viewer.
- Navigation integration — Sidebar "OCR履歴" → `/ocr-sessions`.

Scope guardrails honored: no schema change, no migration, no production deploy, no merge to main. Customer/vehicle data never overwritten automatically; every OCR result still requires explicit user confirmation; no AI-learning functionality introduced. Sprint 1 orchestration + duplicate-detection core preserved. Architecture preserved (dealer_id always from `getCurrentDealer()`; RLS assumptions unchanged).

### Sprint 6 — Phase 2 Integration QA & Stabilization — ✅ Completed (2026-06-30)

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Completed | ✅ |
| Committed | ✅ `fix: phase2 integration stabilization` (09138fd) |
| Pushed | ✅ feature branch `fix/branding-schema-block` (not merged to main) |
| Typecheck | ✅ `npm run typecheck` passed |
| Build | ✅ `npm run build` passed |
| Phase 2 | 🟡 Ready for closure review (not yet closed) |
| Phase 3 | 🔴 Not started |

**Verified work:**
- Customer Management flow verified.
- Vehicle Management flow verified.
- OCR registration flow verified.
- Duplicate customer detection verified.
- Duplicate vehicle detection verified.
- Existing customer / vehicle selection flow verified.
- Register / Update decision flow verified.
- Navigation integration verified (Customers ↔ Vehicles ↔ OCR review ↔ OCR history).

**Three integration bugs found and fixed:**
1. Wizard — stale `existingCustomerId` after adopting a duplicate then navigating back (fixed with an `adoptedCustomerFromDup` flag + reset on re-entry).
2. Customer list 業者/個人 filter broken — `get-customers.ts` did not select `is_business` (added `is_business`, `trade_discount_pct`, `credit_terms`).
3. Wizard — confirm customer card could vanish for an adopted duplicate absent from the page snapshot (added fallback to the duplicate-detection result).

**Known limitations (recorded):**
- `model_code` (型式指定番号) is captured but not persisted — no DB column exists (would require a future migration).
- Vehicle "紐付きなし" filter always returns 0 because `vehicles.customer_id` is NOT NULL.
- Duplicate detection / list filtering remain client-side over dealer-scoped, page-loaded data (not server-paginated).
- OCR correction history shows the corrected result, not a raw-vs-corrected field diff.

Scope guardrails honored: documentation/verification + bug fixes only — no new features, no schema change, no migration, no UI redesign, no production deploy, no merge to main. dealer_id always from `getCurrentDealer()`; RLS assumptions unchanged. **Phase 2 is ready for closure review but NOT closed; Phase 3 not started.**
